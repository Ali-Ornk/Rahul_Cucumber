 If we gonna use same steps we dont need to create step definition all the time
 We can use same definition. If we change or add a new step we should create new definition





 @When User sign up  with with following details
    | Jenny | abcd | John@abdc.com | Australia | 3242353|   // for creating data table we need to put " | " between,beginning and end of datas

      @When("^User sign up  with with following details$")
        public void user_sign_up_with_with_following_details(DataTable data){ //when we create step definition we should call "Datatable" and name it
                                                               //Datatable should be "io.cucumber.Datatable" not the other one

         List<List<String>> obj= dataTable.asLists();   //return type must be " List<List<String>>" and asLists() option should have same thing
          System.out.println(obj.get(0).get(0));       //first "get" gets the raw, second "get" gets the element in the given index from selected raw
        }





  @When User login into application with "jin" and password "1234" // if we create a step like that

           @When("^User login into application with \"([^\"]*)\" and password \"([^\"]*)\"$")
             public void user_login_into_application_with_something_and_password_something(String strArg1, String strArg2 ){
             //we have to define appropriate variable type in the step definition method

     NOTE: For defining a data in steps(feature file) we have to put data in "double quotes "


Parameterization :

      Scenario Outline: Home page default login //for testing more data we should have  "Scenario Outline:" not just  Scenario:
         Given User is on landing page
         When User login into application with <Username> and password <password>   // by putting " <> " we should define names we gave into @When
         Then Home page is populated
         And Cards are "true"
         Examples:    //we have to have "Example:" part
           |Username  | password|   //We have to give name to raws
           |user1     | pass1   |
           |user2     | pass2  |
           |user3     | pass3   |
           |user4     | pass4   |
